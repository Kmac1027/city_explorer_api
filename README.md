## Overview: to create an application that will help users find useful information about cities they may be visiting such as current weather fo the week and possible restaurants to visit.

## Getting Started: the user should only ahve to enter the city name of where they would like to visit.

## Architecture: created a backend server to run the front end created by codefellows. using constructor functions and loops we take the information provided through .json files (or APIs) and send it to the front end in a useable form to be rendered to the DOM.
